Giving up the restaurant industry felt like a big decision. In hindsight, it was the only path to take.

## Looking back

The trade was something I very much fell in to. It's the same for most restaurant or bar managers I've known, few set out in their careers planning to do this gruelling, underpaid and undervalued work.

I can only speak within my experience, of course, so bear that in mind as you read. The industry is tough on mind and body, so in particular managers and chefs survive on cigarettes, alcohol and drugs. Everyone you know with their cosy real-world jobs complain that they never see you while you're pulling 15 hour shifts all weekend getting constant grief from all angles: customers, employees and owners.

A ridiculous percentage of people in the restaurant trade have mental health issues. It's difficult to separate cause and effect here, whether it's the case that existing problems mean other jobs are harder to attain or if perhaps it's the hours, pay and general stress of it all that brings out the issues. I suspect it's a great deal of both.

The industry is run on empty promises. If you pick up more hours and take on more responsibility we can look at making you a manager. If we impress this investor we can put your pay up. If you don't take your holiday we might be able to give you a Saturday off next week. I'm done with it.

## On the menu

Troubled times are coming for the trade. Pubs and restaurants are closing at an alarming rate. Big brewing is circling the drain and micros are finding anti-competitive practices by the giants are rendering their unique recipes impossible to develop.

The war on obesity is going to become more of a factor for restaurants as taxes rise and margins suffer and consumers are scared away from calorific food rather than encouraged to exercise.

Councils are using the blunt instrument of licencing laws to batter the on-trade, deemed responsible for alcohol-related disorder and disease despite mounting evidence that off-licence sales should bear responsibility.

The licenced trade is starting to resemble Silicon Valley startup culture as owners abandon sustainable growth models and aim each venture at becoming the next mega-franchise (with venture capitalist backing) or failing soon enough to give them some more shots at making huge money.

## Next for Nico

I'm finally making the time for my pet projects, Android app development and writing. Hopefully I can make the product I'm working on into a business but in all honesty I'm not worried if I can't. It was time to be free from the trade and I'm glad I took that move.
