So the new bar is finally open — here are a few things I learned lately.

## Trust the opinion of experts

If you have a specialist in a particular thing, let them fulfil their role without interfering or making problems for them!

If they are part way through a process, know when the appropriate moments are to question the direction of their work and when it's best to see it through and evaluate after the fact. Very few things are permanent, the majority are part of a cycle of planning, executing and evaluating.

## but know when you are the one with the expertise

Don't be talked out of things you know to be right when you're leading on a specific aspect.

Remember that the responsibilities you carry were given to you based on your experience and knowledge: this is what your employer is buying when they hire you and should be respected. Be bold with decision making — don't expect others to take responsibility — but stay focused on the end goal.

## and learn, learn, learn

Surround yourself with people who have confidence in what they know and are proud to teach what they can do. Take away every scrap of information because you never know when it might be worth having. Experience in doing a task is worth so much more than a certificate or an unread book.
