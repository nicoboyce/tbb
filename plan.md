*Draft Business Plan version 1*

16.01.2017

Hello.

We're Paula and Nico Boyce, parents of Victor and owners of the Three Bears beer lounge.

We're on a mission to show that craft beer isn't only for the bearded.

Proper, good beer has exploded in Southampton recently, following similar revolutions in Brighton and Portsmouth. No longer do you have to be a part of the CAMRA crowd if you like beer, no more is the only way to get a decent drink out of the cask at the Guide Dog or Waterloo. Real beer - small batch, big flavour - can be found all over town now, particularly in the wealth of wonderful micropubs cropping up, such as the Butcher's Hook, Overdraft and the Bookshop Alehouse. Great.

But the work isn't done.

Fantastic though the new breed of pub is, there's still a problem. Craft beer, particularly on draught, is still almost exclusively the preserve of the bearded. It's a sad fact that in the UK that male beer drinkers outnumber female beer drinkers three to one.

Is this even a problem? So maybe women prefer wine or gin, you might think. Maybe beer doesn't have to be for women too.

Let me assure you that it does. Firstly, is a party of all blokes necessarily a party anyone really wants to be at? Aren't pubs just more fun the more diverse the crowd? Won't many women love these micros like many men do, if only they felt more welcoming to everyone?

Secondly, the product. Scientists say women do, on the whole, have a better palate than men, being somewhat more sensitive to many flavours and on average more able to appreciate great pairings of tastes. Beer is so variable, so able to be flavoured in so many ways that it is actually the perfect product for the female palate and indeed the tastebuds of women are responsible for a lot of the development of beer right from medieval times to today. If we want better beer and a better range of beer, we need diversity of taste in the people that drink it.

Thirdly, beer is just great. I feel this should go without saying. Beer is brilliant and everyone (okay, every adult) deserves the opportunity to enjoy the wonderful world of craft beer that we have now. If brewers and bars aren't marketing their product to half the population, they're denying an invitation to the beer and pub experience.

So what are we going to do about it?

The Three Bears beer lounge will be the first ever micropub with the emphasis on being female friendly. We're not making a bar exclusively for women, we're building an environment where both sexes can enjoy a great drink. We're pioneering this, not because we want to get into this vast untapped market for a quick and easy buck but because we want to be the place where we would want to be.

We've looked long and hard at what makes a pub more male than female and what elements are more welcoming to all and we've designed a venue that will be at once unique and yet familiar, somewhere everyone can feel comfortable and no-one will feel unwelcome.

So say goodbye to the bar stools, Sky Sports, the brewers who can't brew a blonde ale without drawing a pinup on the pump clip. Welcome to a place where we can all enjoy a great drink in comfort.

Welcome to the Three Bears.
