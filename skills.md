## Leadership and management

As a leader of a team I believe in a hands-on, by example approach. I like to teach and develop skills in my staff and to see them progress and take responsibility over time. Incentivisation is a useful tool but far from the only or best motivator in a strong team.

I have studied management techniques and theories such as Kaizen (the Toyota Way) and Six Sigma and I take a strong position against waste, inefficiency and repeated errors. I'm not a passenger, I'm the driver steering a route to higher profit through cost-effectiveness, delivering value to customers *and* strong margins for business owners.

## Creative and challenging

For me as a manager in the trade nothing delights me more than surprising and challenging guests with new and creative food and drink. Whether I'm developing classy cocktails or behemoth burgers, the guarantee is that it won't be the same-old!

I take the same attitude to every aspect of a business I work in. A bit of creative thinking coupled with efficiency-increasing improvement cycles such as Kaizen can rejuvinate the feel of a venue for guests and staff, simplifying and amplifying the pleasure of the entire experience.

## Local and craft produce

A strong advocate of high quality and unique fare, I have strong relationships with a good number of local brewers in particular. I'm not excited to see the homogenisation of our town centres and I avoid big brand beer and and the mega-chain pubs.

Saying no to mass-produced is far from the quirky lifestyle choice it was just a few years ago, it's often a highly profitable, environmentally conscious, healthier and happier way to be for many businesses and consumers.
