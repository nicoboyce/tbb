Our main product will be a range of bottled and canned craft beers and real ales, as well as a select range of bottled ciders.

### Why Bottled and Canned Beer?

Bottled beer, and even more so, canned beer has until recently been seen as a poor compromise solution and an unpopular alternative to draught beer, suitable only for situations where draught is unavailable. This belief has very much died with the craft beer revolution.

Where packaged beer was once dull in flavour, inconsistently carbonated and generally as a concept neglected by the better brewers, it is now an enormous growth area in many bars. We will be stocking packaged beer and cider for a number of key reasons:

* Respected brewers focus on packaged

  Many of the most respected brewers, such as Cloudwater and Brewdog here in the UK and foreign craft giants like Stone and Mikkeller primarily produce packaged beverages, with many of their lines unavailable in keg or cask.

* Better range

  Economics and logistics dictate that a bar can stock many times the range of drinks in bottles than it can in barrels. A very wide choice will be one of our selling points.

* Stock control

  Stocktaking a cellar is one of the major issues of pub ownership - it’s almost impossible to know if or how you’re losing a few pints here and there if you’re dealing primarily with draught. Simply not a problem for packaged product.

* Off-sales

  In Southampton, despite a push in bars such as Sadler’s and Brewdog, takeaway draught beer hasn’t really taken off in any significant way. For home drinking, packaged beer is teh most popular.

* Imported craft

  Packaged is the easiest way to get hold of and the best way to store imported beer.

* Expansion potential

  The posibility of local delivery, mail order or a mobile bar are all routes to expanding the business and only really economically possible with a focus on packaged.
