title: The State of Social Media in 2017
---

Conventional wisdom is that social media marketing has never been so crucial to local small business, particularly in the restaurant and bar trade. But what works and what is a waste of time?

## Visual is key

Your number one priority has to be getting pictures in front of your potential customers. You can't make people experience in advance the taste of your products but through images you can let them know what it feels like.

Photos don't just show what your food looks like. Probably more important is the suggestion of what the environment is like in your venue. The lighting gives away a great deal about the ambience, any background detail may not be consciously noticed but will have a big impact on the impression the viewer gets.

## Generating authenticity

That said, don't get your photographer in just yet. For your pictures to have real impact, you want them to be the work of your guests.

Everyone has a healthy dose of cynicism about them now and the way to find trust is through curated customer to customer interaction.

So like and share the hell out of everything that paints you in a positive light and make sure the best customer photos are see on all platforms, with credit so it's clear they're the work of someone who came to you and had a good time.

## Don't waste resources

Every single communication on social media needs to be on message and optimised for your market.

Don't go off on tangents, don't rant, don't bore. Keep focused but with a dose of fun.

Text-only posts are basically dead as a marketing tool. Don't waste your time: no one will read them and if anyone does they feel sterile and empty now. Everything needs an appropriate and quality photo.

## So which platforms

In my opinion, Instagram is the absolute best platform for social media marketing of small, local businesses right now.

It benefits from being easily searchable by location and by tags so you can find what people are producing that's related to your business.

Because it's a Facebook product now you have the powerful advertising tools they've developed.

Instagram integrates well with Facebook business pages and with Twitter via sharing tools.

People typically have fewer followers and follow fewer accounts than on other social networks, so you get proportionately more eyeball time. It doesn't feel like you're interrupting chatter with family and friends so much as Facebook. You're not shouting into the abyss like on Twitter.
