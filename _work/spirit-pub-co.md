I have been a team leader at two Spirit (now Greene King) pubs, the Thatched House and the Encore. Each provided a distinct set of challenges and were a great education in the licensed trade.

The Thatched House is a food-led establishment known as a family pub. Here I focused on bar training for the team and stock management. Ensuring compliance with relevant public safety legislation was also a responsibility. I achieved several 100% mystery guest visits on my shifts. With my help, the team focused on sales and guest satisfaction.

At the Encore, a wet-led pub with a strong regular clientele but also popular with visitors to the theatre next-door, I had a wide range of responsibilities including SIBA and Carlsberg ordering and cellar maintenance, line-cleaning and so on. Beyond that I held the supplementary role of hospitality coach, which required attending monthly area meetings and presenting to the team the latest teaching from the company about the guest experience in pubs, also I managed the Encore social media pages.
