## Previous employment

### Chalk Valley Farm & Kitchen

From May to November I led the expansion of Chalk Valley from being a small and unremarkable burger bar to a much larger and more premium venue serving local craft beer, farm-to-table barbecue and a range of countryside cocktails.

My role at CV was very broad, from developing mixed drinks and drink menus to overseeing the reconstruction of the new unit to day-to-day managerial functions. I also had to recruit and train a new bar team, learn the recipes and processes of the kitchen and plan future developments with the restaurant owner.

### Sadler's Brewhouse & Barbecue

A collaboration between Sadler's brewery in Stourbridge and the team behind the famous Rockstone pub in Bevois Valley, Sadler's Brewhouse & Barbecue quickly became one of Southampton's most popular bar/restaurants. With nine handpumps and an extraordinarily comprehensive range on the backbar, we were a popular "occasion" destination with a simple menu of American barbecue food.

### The Leopold Tavern

I formerly worked at the Leopold Tavern, home to Southsea's greatest range of beers.

The multiple Portsmouth CAMRA pub of the year boasts ten handpumps for traditional ale and also nine draught beers and ciders so naturally cellar management is a major factor. Our ale range completely changed twice weekly and we were also known for a wide array of craft bottles.

The Leopold prides itself on not stocking the typical big brand lagers, nor selling shots and in doing so the tavern has carved a distinct niche for itself in an area rich with pubs, justifying it's long-held number one spot on TripAdvisor.

### Spirit Pub Company

I have been a team leader at two Spirit pubs, the Thatched House and the Encore.

The Thatched House is a food-led establishment known as a family pub. Here I focused on bar training for the team and stock management. Ensuring compliance with relevant public safety legislation was also a responsibility. I achieved several 100% mystery guest visits on my shifts. With my help, the team focused on sales and guest satisfaction.

At the Encore, a drink-led pub with a strong regular clientele but also popular with visitors to the theatre next-door, I had a wide range of responsibilities including SIBA and Carlsberg ordering and cellar maintenance, line-cleaning and so on. Beyond that I held the supplementary role of hospitality coach, which required attending monthly area meetings and presenting to the team the latest teaching about the guest experience in pubs.

### Pubwatchers UK

I previously had a role at Pubwatchers, a company that supplies services to breweries including security for pubs being refitted. At this job I learned the basics about pub infrastructure and the trade in general.

## Qualifications, Volunteering and Other Experience

I'm a big believer in volunteering and kept myself busy with this at university while studying physics.
