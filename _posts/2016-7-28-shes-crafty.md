Anyone in the trade will be sick of being asked this one question: "Is it craft?"

Unfortunately, unlike the term "real ale" there's no agreement yet in the battle over the "craft" description in this country. There's no Campaign for Craft Beer (though who knows what will come of CAMRA's consultation and review!) and an industry group agreement in the UK seems miles off. In America, the Brewers' Association have established [their own definition](https://www.brewersassociation.org/brewers-association/craft-brewer-definition/) of craft brewing but the numbers involved do seem rather arbitrary.

## Can we recognise craft when we see it?

I think we can certainly agree on what _isn't_ craft...obviously the big brand lagers aren't, Guinness isn't (even their West Indies porter â€” tasty but not craft) and Greene King IPA definitely isn't. But where is the line drawn?

For me, the defining feature of a craft brewer (or a craft distiller, for that matter) is authenticity. Even if BrewDog were the country's biggest brewer they would still be regarded as a craft brewery if they kept true to the principles they uphold. Beers like Shipyard, Frontier, Revisionist...they're not fooling anyone.

Perhaps a more descriptive term than craft could become trendy. Small-batch beer. Indie beer. I don't know. Until then, big brewing will keep trying desperately to pick up craft brands and leech off of the success of the many wonderful new breweries.
