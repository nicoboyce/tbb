Starting things can be pretty tough. Setting a ball rolling requires overcoming inertia. Changes are often weird and scary.

It is in these moments of uncertainty, however, that we can surprise ourselves. Overcome our fears and challenge our rivals.

I am Nico. I've made a lot of mistakes on the way to wherever the hell I am today but I feel that I've got something to share with my peers and this is where I will do that.

In the mean time, for more about who I am try clicking [about](https://nicoboyce.github.io/about) or to get in touch try the links below.
