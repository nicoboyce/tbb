title: The Structure of Excellence
---

We all know the famous quote, usually attributed to Einstein, defining insanity as "doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results" - nowhere is this more true than in the restaurant trade.

## Identify failure

Every business needs to have a process to pick up systems and routines that aren't functioning as intended. If the systems aren't being followed correctly, we must ask what is preventing them or how to streamline the routine. If the routines are being followed but issues are still arising, the system itself is broken and needs reconsidering.

## Expand excellence

Hopefully not every system is failing! But a process needs to be applied to these too.
