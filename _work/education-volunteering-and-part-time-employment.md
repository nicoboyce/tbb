title: Education, Volunteering and Part-Time Employment
---

From 2006 to 2013 I was a student at the University of Southampton. During that time I had a few part-time jobs and also kept myself exceptionally busy with voluntary roles.

My course was Physics with Photonics and despite a long period of serious illness I was awarded a DipHE Physics in 2013.

I was a very active member of the student union, runner up in the election for Union President and represented the student body on the Union Council and the Welfare Committee.

A well-known name and face on campus, I was heavily involved in student media, including being an editor of the then independent Soton Tab publication. I led the referendum campaign to remain outside of the NUS which was an enormous success, [winning the vote by a ratio of three to one](https://www.wessexscene.co.uk/news/2012/12/07/southampton-students-vote-no-to-nus-reaction-and-interviews/).

I've volunteered with mental health groups such as Time to Change, Mind and also Early Intervention in Psychosis.

While a student, I had part time jobs at the Co-op (chiefly responsible for the morning deliveries) and at Pubwatchers UK where I had responsibility for the security of closed pubs and oversaw refit work.
