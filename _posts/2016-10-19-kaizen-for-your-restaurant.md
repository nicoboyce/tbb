title: Kaizen for your Restaurant
---

We're probably all familiar with so-called "management fads" and if you're anything like me, tempted to roll your eyes and switch off when a business development manager or owner shows up with the latest hardback. But can a principle like Kaizen, born from Japanese manufacturing processes, bring anything to your restaurant?

## Continuous incremental improvement

If your job is similar to mine, you probably look around your venue each day and see many details that could use the time to rethink. Deploying Kaizen may be your route to eliminating these inefficiencies.

* Teams of employees at all levels present sources of waste

* Kaizen events focus the team on improving specific areas

* Employees then become actively engaged in identifying and implementing developments

* This becomes the natural way of thinking for managers and their teams.

## Culture shift feeds improved engagement and morale

We ran a trial incentivising our team, giving rewards for excellent performance. The defining moment for me was when informing a chef he was our latest employee of the week and he asked for an improved piece of equipment rather than any kind of reward. Without knowing it, he was embodying the Kaizen philosophy.

* Developing a culture where the whole team are actively engaged in improvement

* Organising events focused on improving specific areas.

*Consistent application of the latter reinforces the former.*

## The conclusion is there is no conclusion

In every sense, this is a work in progress. We're going to need to develop the appropriate systems to allow these improvement focuses to feed upstream. These systems themselves should be subject to the continuous improvement concept.

*Please don't be shy about sending me feedback! This is by definition a learning process for us all.*
