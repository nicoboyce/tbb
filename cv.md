## Previous employment

**Staggeringly Good Brewery with the Beer Musketeer** — *July 2017*

* Led the on-the-night team organisation at WarriorFest, a large and unusual beer event.
* Coordinated staff across five bars, troubleshooting issues with dispense systems and logistics.
* Liased with the brewery team and the location events crew to ensure all stock and equipment was accounted for and the site vacated efficiently.

**Red Chutney** — *May 2017*

* Provided location catering on the set of a big-budget Disney production.
* Assisted the executive chef and took responsibility for site health and safety in demanding conditions.
* Challenges included providing a varied breakfast, lunch and dinner menu of fresh, top quality food for set breaks to large
numbers of people across the location.

**Chalk Valley Farm & Kitchen** — *May - December 2016*

* Hired initially to take overall control of the proposed expansion of the restaurant, an independent, premium, fast-casual,
farm-to-table venue in a city-centre location.
* Introduced a menu of 14 draught local craft beers, rotated weekly, alongside a seasonal cocktail menu featuring locally foraged
ingredients. Pivoted the focus of the restaurant from premium, hand made burgers to a much more scalable menu of American
barbecue cuisine, while maintaining our ethic of promoting and selling local, organic and traditionally farmed meat.
* Subsequently, now as the acting restaurant manager, led a program of upgrading, reconfiguring and replacing systems we had
outgrown, such as the EPOS and kitchen tickets, the environment management systems and the security and communication
infrastructure.
* Retrained and expanded the team for a move to full service, planned and implemented incentivisation and linked it in with the
introduction of Kaizen (the Toyota way) as our long-term development strategy.

**Sadler's Brewhouse & Barbecue** — *February - May 2016*

* Temporary role at a rapidly growing American restaurant with large spirit and real ale ranges.
* Brought my beer expertise and cellar management skills to the small and relatively inexperienced management team.
* Worked with the bar manager to develop the beverage range and team knowledge.

**The Leopold Tavern** — *April 2015 - February 2016*

* The originator in the now huge Southsea craft beer scene, the Leopold was as legendary for its exemplary customer service as
it was its vast beverage range.
* With a completely new menu of ten real ales and over a hundred bottled beers each week, developing relationships with local
brewers and key national suppliers was almost as great a task as stock and cellar management.
* Team training was a key part of the role, as guest expectations were high and a great deal of knowledge on all styles of beer
were necessary for the whole staff.

**Spirit Pub Company** — *December 2013 - April 2015*

* Led shifts and managed stock, alongside learning the crucial skills of recruitment, analysis of sales figures and team development.
* Met monthly with the Business Development Manager to discuss front-of-house training and progress in mystery guest reports,
informing my running of team meetings and leading incentive schemes.
* Introduced a strong focus on local cask ale, adding additional beer lines, offering a discount for CAMRA members and gaining
Cask Marque certification.

* Volunteered at nationally coordinated events to raise awareness of mental health issues.
* Co-chaired mental health awareness week committee.

**Soton Tab Publications** — *2012 - 2014*

* Responsibility for all opinion pieces and editorials in the renowned independent student tabloid.
* Led a fundraising round to secure the future of the publication, including successfully pitching to the university to secure a

* Co-managed the social media pages, delivering content to a following of fifteen thousand students, staff and alumni of the
university.
* Our editorial team produced comprehensive statistical testing on our web analytics, developing a highly optimised and efficient
publishing schedule across all platforms.

the face-to-face vote drive.
* Achieved a resounding victory for the union independence movement against a well-funded pro-NUS group with heavy support
from the national president.

**University of Southampton Students' Union** — *2012-2013*

* Elected to sit on the highest decision-making body in the union, leader of the opposition faction.
* Provided the council with oversight on the actions of the Welfare Committee, bringing support to disability access and mental
health awareness campaigns.
