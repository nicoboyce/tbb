Managers and those who aspire to be managers will all have battled at some point with this decision â€” whether to work in a brewery pub or chain restaurant or whether to move to an independent venue. Let's bust some myths.

## Chains are where you find promotion opportunities

Are they? Sure, the hierarchy is a different shape in a big company to a small place, but does that mean there are routes to take upwards from your level?

Some companies do love to promote from within, but from GM level upwards people seem to me to get comfortable, entrench and settle. It's a big leap from AM or DGM to GM and an even bigger one from GM to BDM or equivalent.

While some indie owners are happy to have one successful shop, most see a cycle of expansion and investment as key to making the business what they want it to be. This means trying to avoid the growing pains of the first for each successive opening and that means taking the best of your experienced crew and moving them around.

At the end of the day, each company has its own way of working when it comes to recruitment and advancement. Do your research before you take on a role and you'll move upwards, not sideways.

## Indies have all the freedom

For owners, new bars are like babies. They want to nurture and grow their business and they want it to turn out just as they hoped.

Sure, some chains send you a menu, a drinks list and control just about everything. But don't think working for an independent owner is any different. Just replace the tried and true, if boring, formula of the company with the overbearing father figure of an owner who can be subject to whims and persuaded by other factors.

We all dream of a boss who keeps writing the cheques without placing restrictions on how you operate, but the money has to be respected and this always means compromise. Yours.

## Premium chains pay better

Every company has its own renumeration structure. Some are rigid and won't negotiate but some will. Every independent will always negotiate, but then you'll always be in a buyer's market. Find me a place with few experienced managers but high demand and I'll be there tomorrow.

The one thing that doesn't pay in this business is loyalty. Know what you're worth, apply for every comparable role and put yourself first. You can bring offers back to your current boss and renegotiate, just be honest. The worst they can say is "no", the worst you can say is "goodbye!"

## You can't reshape a chain venue; you can always leave a mark on an indie

I've seen GMs totally transform places and push them in new directions despite their brand, I've seen managers battle with owners totally set in their ways despite shrinking business in indies.

At the end of the day, you bring your own skills and experience to a venue and it's for your owner or head office to decide how they are used. Everywhere I have worked gave me something to take away, everywhere I worked I feel I left something behind.
